## Why Python <a name = "whycplusplus"></a>
Because for starters (like me), this language is excellent to understand in a easily way codes structures, in my opinion. Because for me, to have a language that have such a simple syntax to understand is important to get around with language that aren't so begginer's friendly. Sooooo...Python is my starter point.

## Why am I Doing This? <a name = "whyimdoingthis"></a>
This is part of my efforts to get better at Python, here I begun to redoing some small projects to understand more of the language that I'm studying.
So I'll do nothing so complex and nothing too original, but actually is just for getting around and have a good understand at what I'm looking for in these studies.

### Info

some of this little codes will need special requirements to work properly, i will put this requirements on their README.md in each file.

For example, for run the little game of the Snake on Windows you'll need the windows-curses installed.
you will just need to use:

```
pip install windows-curses
```

## That's it <a name = "thatsit"></a>

For now I will keep in some small coding until i feel secure enough to try my own ideas, so follow me to see what I could do in the future.
